# 203_2827 Support \bold command

## How to test
1. Create a LaTeX file containing `\bold{test}`.
2. Import the file into `.tm` format.
3. Verify that the imported document correctly renders "test" in bold text, identical to how `\mathbf{test}` is normally handled, instead of showing a raw red `\bold` tag.

## 2026/02/21 Support \bold command
### What
Added support for the `\bold` command within the LaTeX plugin's import logic.

### Why
To resolve issue #2827. The original LaTeX parser treated `\bold` as an undefined macro during import. This resulted in an unsupported red tag appearing in the Mogan editor.

### How
1. In `TeXmacs/plugins/latex/progs/convert/latex/latex-command-drd.scm`, registered `bold` in the `latex-modifier-1%` logic group so the parser recognizes it as a standard single-argument formatting macro.
2. In `TeXmacs/plugins/latex/progs/convert/latex/tmtex.scm`, added a proxy translation rule inside `post-process-math-text`: `((func? t 'bold 1) (post-process-math-text (list 'mathbf (cadr t))))`. This intercepts `\bold` and delegates it to `\mathbf`, ensuring that it inherits all necessary logic for properly rendering both text and math content into bold.
