#[201_87] Fix LaTeX formula imports using "aligned" to show correct numbering format
## 2026/02/25 Fix equation numbering alignment in `aligned` environment
### What
Redefined `aligned*`, `alignedat*`, and `alignedat` in `env-math.ts` to produce inline `tformat` tables instead of delegating to `align*`/`align`.
### Why
Issue #2804 : when using `aligned` inside `equation`, the equation number (1) appeared below the multi-line expression instead of vertically centered to the right. The root cause was that `aligned*` was aliased to `align*`.
This caused the equation number to be appended sequentially after the block rather than inline beside it.
### How
Changed the body of `aligned*` from `<align*|<tformat|<arg|body>>>` to a inline `tformat` with explicit settings. This makes `aligned` behave as an inline math construct with natural width and no block wrapping, so the equation number is placed correctly to the right.
