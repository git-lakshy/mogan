# 212_2: Fix hyperlinks unclickable in beamer PDF export

## Issue
Hyperlinks become invalid and unclickable after exporting a slideshow/beamer presentation to PDF. (Issue #2843)

## How to test
1. Open `TeXmacs/tests/tmu/212_2_beamer_hlink.tmu`
2. Export as PDF via File → Export → Pdf...
3. Open the exported PDF and verify all hyperlinks are clickable

### What
Fixed hyperlinks (`hlink`) becoming unclickable after exporting a beamer presentation to PDF.

### Why
When exporting a beamer presentation to PDF, `wrapped-print-to-file` creates a temporary buffer copy, calls `dynamic-make-slides` to expand slides, then calls `print-to-file` (→ C++ `print_doc`).

In `print_doc`, `typeset_as_document` creates a typesetter, typesets the document (registering link/ID observers in global tables), then immediately destroys the typesetter — which unregisters all link observers.

During the rendering loop that follows, `display_links` (called by `box_rep::redraw` for non-screen renderers) queries these global link tables via `get_ids()`/`get_links()`. But the tables are now empty because the typesetter was already destroyed. So `ren->href()` is never called, and no link annotations appear in the PDF.

For regular documents, the screen-display typesetter from the original buffer is still alive with its link registrations. But for beamer export, the temporary buffer copy has no prior typesetting history — hence unclickable hyperlinks.

### How
- Inlined `typeset_as_document` in `print_doc` and deferred `delete_typesetter` until after the rendering loop, so link registrations persist through `display_links` calls
- Added a free-function `typeset(typesetter)` wrapper in `typesetter.hpp`/`typesetter.cpp` to avoid needing the `typesetter_rep` class definition in `edit_main.cpp`
